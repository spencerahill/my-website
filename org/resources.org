This page comprises a loosely organized collection of resources I have found
useful.  Your mileage may vary.

** Reproducible research via org-mode
[[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] is an extension of the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][Emacs]] text editor for creating outline-like
documents, with lots of functionality for embedding to-do lists, links, code,
and images and for converting the files to LaTeX, HTML, and other formats.

This integration of elements typically found in scientific manuscripts makes
Org-mode a potentially useful vehicle for [[http://reproducibleresearch.net/][reproducible research]] -- checkout this
[[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/08/08/What-we-are-using-org-mode-for/][page]].

In fact, my website is written as a collection of org-mode files, published
to HTML using org's publish functionality.  Source code [[https://github.com/spencerahill/my-website][here]].

* Python
I am an avid user of the [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] programming language, which is modern, powerful,
elegant, open-source, and well-documented.  In addition to the [[file:aospy.org][aospy]] project, I
also have a few other, less polished open-source Python packages that I have
created as side projects; they are available on [[https://github.com/spencerahill][my Github]].
