This page comprises a loosely organized collection of resources I have found
useful.  Your mileage may vary.

** Emacs and org-mode
[[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] is an extension of the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][Emacs]] text editor for creating outline-like
documents, with lots of functionality for embedding to-do lists, links, code,
and images and for converting the files to LaTeX, HTML, and other formats.

In fact, my website is written as a collection of org-mode files, published to
HTML using org's publish functionality.  Source code [[https://github.com/spencerahill/my-website][here]].  (Though since I
created it while a graduate student, other tools for making good academic websites
have improved a lot, and I'm not 100% sure I'd recommend doing it this way these
days!)

Some useful Emacs-related things:

| [[https://emacsformacosx.com/][Emacs for Mac OS X]]   | Easily install GUI version of Emacs on Mac OS X/macOS                              |
| [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] | Library for linking environment variables that Emacs sees with your system values. |
* Python
I am an avid user of the [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] programming language, which is modern, powerful,
elegant, open-source, and well-documented.  In addition to the [[file:aospy.org][aospy]] project, I
also have a few other, less polished open-source Python packages that I have
created as side projects; they are available on [[https://github.com/spencerahill][my Github]].
