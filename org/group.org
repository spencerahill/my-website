Welcome to the New York Climate Investigations: Theory To Impacts, a.k.a. New York
CITTI, research group.  We seek end-to-end understanding of climate processes,
meaning from fundamental analytical theory to quantifying their real-world
impacts.  We have two main research strands:

1. Monsoon rainfall.  What controls when, where, and how intensely it rains
   within Earth's monsoon systems?
2. Weather and climate impacts on New York City.

Beyond science, my big passions are my family (wife, daughter, dog), and music.
I deeply love my adopted hometown of NYC.  My favorite pizza in the city (and
therefore the world) is Lucali for whole pie and Bleecker Street Pizza for
slices.  My favorite bagels in the city (and therefore the world) are Absolute
Bagel for a bagel w/ cream cheese and the original Russ & Daughters for a lox
sandwich.
