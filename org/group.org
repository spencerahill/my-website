Welcome to the New York Climate Investigations: Theory To Impacts, a.k.a. New York
CITTI, research group.  We seek end-to-end understanding of climate processes,
meaning from fundamental analytical theory to quantifying their real-world
impacts.  We have two main research strands:

1. Monsoon rainfall.  What controls when, where, and how intensely it rains
   within Earth's monsoon systems?
2. Weather and climate impacts on New York City.

My biggest passions are my wonderful family (wife, daughter, dog), science, and
music.  I deeply love my adopted hometown of NYC.  My favorite pizza in the city
(and therefore the world) is Lucali for whole pie and Bleecker Street Pizza for
slices.  My favorite bagels in the city (and therefore the world) are Absolute
Bagel for a bagel w/ cream cheese and the original Russ & Daughters for a lox
sandwich.

Inspired by the 2023 Northeast wildfire season, I am currently working to
understand the influence of large scale synoptic features on the trajectory of
wildfire smoke plumes. In my free time I love learning foreign languages and
taking care of my plants.  https://dynamicplanet.net/
