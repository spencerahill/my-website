* Overview
(site last updated {{{modification-time(%Y %B %d)}}})

I am a climate scientist interested in tropical overturning circulations
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon][monsoons]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell][Hadley cells]], and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone][Intertropical Convergence Zone]]) --- why they
exist, how they ebb and flow over the course of each year, how well we can
predict their variations from year to year, how they may have changed in Earth's
history, how they may change in Earth's future, and even how they behave in
other planetary atmospheres.  Please see my [[file:publications.org][Publications]] page for more.

I work at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, where I
am funded by an Earth Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship and advised by [[http://www.columbia.edu/~ahs129/home.html][Dr. Adam
Sobel]] and [[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~biasutti/][Dr. Michela Biasutti]].  Along with [[https://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2371/][Mark Cane]] and collaborators in
India, we are working on a project seeking to improve forecasts of Indian
monsoon summer rainfall on seasonal timescales.

I am also co-leader of the "[[https://diynamics.github.io/][DIYnamics]]" project that seeks to improve the
teaching of meteorology, climate science, and other planetary-scale sciences at
the K-12 through graduate school levels by developing inexpensive, easy-to-use
kits for performing physical demonstrations of core scientific concepts.  Please
see the [[file:outreach.org][DIYnamics]] page, the [[https://diynamics.github.io/][official DIYnamics website]], or the [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUHxOSVY4G4OFbF8XL1qUg][DIYnamics YouTube
channel]] for more.

I am also interested in developing software tools for scientists in
the Python programming language.  Please see the [[file:aospy.org][aospy]], [[file:programming.org][Programming]], and
[[file:resources.org][Resources]] pages for more.

Please contact me (information below) with any questions about my research or
anything else you find on this site.  Thanks!
