Essentially all planetary bodies rotate about their own axis at some rate; in
the solar system this ranges from Jupiter (roughly 2.5 times faster than Earth's
rate) to Venus (roughtly 240 times slower than Earth's rate).  This rotation
fundamentally constrains the motions of planetary atmospheres, oceans, and
interior fluids, giving rise to the scientific field of "geophysical fluid
dynamics", or GFD.  The influence of this planetary rotation can be nicely
demonstrated by placing a tank of water on a rotating surface and using food
coloring to visualize the flows within the tank.

Demonstrations such as these are of value for students even at the elementary
school level, but their presence in elementary, middle, and high school
curricula is limited by prohibitively expensive materials and insufficient
expertise in the relevant science.  Outreach events at underserved schools by
university groups are useful but cannot scale.

We are developing a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) "kit" comprising affordable,
easy-to-find parts that are easily assembled into a functional rotating table
apparatus, along with instructional materials for teachers on assembling the
table, executing the demonstrations, and conveying the relevant scientific
concepts for each demonstration.
