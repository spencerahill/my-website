* Overview
I am interested in the atmospheric dynamics of Earth and other planets,
especially tropical overturning circulations and their attendant features:
monsoons, Hadley cells, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).  The
emphasis is on advancing our theoretical understanding of these circulations,
both as they naturally occur and how they are perturbed by external
forcings.  For Earth, the latter includes the potential effects of human-induced
climate change as well as understanding the salient drivers of Earth's past
climate states (a.k.a. "paleoclimate").

See below for summaries of (some of) the projects I'm currently working on or
have worked on previously, or see the [[file:publications.org][Publications]] and [[file:cv.org][CV]] pages for more formal
summaries of my research output to date.

* Control on migrations of the tropical rainbelt on Earth and other planets
When averaged across all longitudes (i.e. "zonally averaged"), the atmospheric
circulation near the equator on most planetary bodies comprises one or two
(depending on the season) overturning cells; these are the Hadley cells.  The
ascending branch of this Hadley circulation coincides with strong convergence of
air in the planetary boundary layer (i.e. near the surface), and in moist
atmospheres generates a band of strong precipitation.  These convergence and
precipitation features are collectively known as the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ).

On Earth, the ITCZ moves north and south during the seasonal cycle, from the
northern hemisphere subtropics during northern summer to the southern hemisphere
subtropics during southern summer, and back again.  What sets this latitudinal
range?  Why doesn't it move farther poleward or less far?  [[https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-16-0014.1][/Faulk et al. 2017/]]
showed in an "aquaplanet" climate model that, all else being Earth-like,
planetary rotation rate is one of the dominant controls: the slower the planet
is rotating, the farther poleward the ITCZ can move.

We are currently investigating the underlying dynamical and thermodynamic
influences on this behavior through simulations using an even simpler model
(i.e. a dry dynamical core), one with no moist processes and even further
simplified treatments of radiative transfer and other processes.

* Vegetation-atmosphere interactions and the "Green Sahara" paleoclimate state
Roughly 10,000 years ago, most of today's Sahara Desert was not a desert at all;
paleoclimate proxy records of lake levels, precipitation, and vegetation cover
suggest that a large portion was vegetated and received many times the amount of
rainfall compared to today.  The root driver of this "Green Sahara" state was
almost certainly a stronger gradient of incoming solar radiation ("insolation")
in the northern hemisphere during summer caused by gradual changes in Earth's
orbital configuration, which enabled the tropical rainbelt of equatorial Africa
to extend farther northward.

However, as plants extended into the desert, they also increased its surface
albedo (i.e. darkened it, thereby increasing its absorption of insolation) and
increased its capacity to retain water, both of which feed back positively on
the original vegetation expansion.  A popular hypothesis is that this
"vegetation-albedo feedback" was a necessary condition for this African Humid
Period and fueled rapid onset and demise of the Green Sahara roughly 12,000 and
6,000 years ago, respectively (although there are disagreements as to how rapid
these climatic changes were).  Climate model simulations of this time period
generally fail to generate appreciable wettening of the Sahara unless a darkened
surface is prescribed, thereby hard-coding in the vegetation-driven albedo
change.

This inability of the full complexity climate models to match the proxy records
has motivated us to investigate the problem using a series of simpler models.
The first step is developing a simple moist energy balance model of the region
that can reproduce the modern day climate and that generates a greening of the
Sahara when perturbed with the proper orbital changes.  The second step is to
accomplish the same thing in an idealized moist climate model; this will require
creating a simple vegetation model that makes surface albedo potentially
sensitive to e.g. precipitation.

* "Meta" thinking on climate model hierarchies
Numerical simulation using climate models is a central component of my research,
and my approach to using these models is strongly influenced by the work of
[[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/isaac-held-homepage][Isaac Held]] and others on using climate model hierarchies to improve
understanding; see [[http://library.wmo.int/opac/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=6209#.Va_9-0WrO_c][Bony et al. 2011]] and [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-86-11-1609][Held 2005]].  I am a co-author on a paper
summarizing the state of hierarchical climate modeling, [[http://nadirjeevanjee.com/papers/jeevanjee2017a.pdf][Jeevanjee et al. 2017]],
that was inspired by the World Climate Research Programme's [[https://www.wcrp-climate.org/gc-model-hierarchies-home][Model Hierarchies
Workshop]] at Princeton University in November 2016.

* The African Sahel
The Sahel is the semi-arid transitional region that straddles the southern edge
of the Sahara desert and the northern edge of appreciable wet-season rainfall.
The region, which spans several countries and is home to millions of people,
suffered intense drought during the 1970s.  It is also a veritable poster child
for uncertainty in future hydroloclimatic changes -- climate model projections
span from sharp decreases to sharp increases in rainfall in the remainder of
this century, even for the same assumed future emissions trajectory.

In [[https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0785.1][/Hill et al. 2017/]], we use an atmospheric climate model forced either with
present-day ocean surface temperatures or with those temperatures uniformly
warmed by 2 degrees Celsius, and we repeat this pair of simulations in the same
model but with its standard representation of moist convection swapped out for
an alternate.  We find that global mean warming acts to dry out the Sahel
through a (slight variation on a) well-known process, the "upped-ante
mechanism": warming increases the difference in moisture between the Sahel and
the adjacent desert, and so prevailing winds from the north acting on this
increased gradient act to dry the northern Sahel.

Nothing about these arguments seemed to us likely to be valid only for the
single atmospheric model that we were using, so we then examined uniform warming
simulations performed in a total of fifteen other atmospheric models developed
by modeling centers across the world.  In all but one of these other models,
uniform warming caused drying in the Sahel largely through this mechanism.  This
was originally reported in Chapter 4 of my Ph.D. thesis; a corresponding journal
article is forthcoming.

* Zonal-mean circulation and energy transports
Human emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols alter both the global mean and
spatial pattern of surface temperatures -- both in the annual mean and
throughout the seasonal cycle.  Whereas greenhouse gases induce mean warming
that tends to be polar amplified, aerosols cool the globe and, being emitted
primarily in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes, cool the northern hemisphere
relative to the south.  How will atmospheric circulation and precipitation
patterns respond to these changes?

It is commonly argued that the hemispherically-asymmetric aerosol forcing pushes
the ITCZ toward the southern hemisphere, as part of a strengthening of northward
energy transport by the Hadley Cells that acts to counter the aerosol cooling
concentrated in the northern hemisphere.  However, the energy transports also
depend on the "gross moist stability", i.e. how much energy is transported per
unit of mass overturning.

In [[https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00165.1][/Hill et al. 2015/]], we use an atmospheric climate model forced by different
ocean surface temperature patterns to investigate the resulting energy transport
changes.  In so doing, we create a new approximation for the change in the gross
moist stability of the Hadley cells, based on the change in the meridional
(north-south) gradient in ocean surface temperatures.  The simulations confirm
that, particularly when there is an appreciable spatial pattern to the ocean
surface warming, the gross moist stability change can actually be an even larger
contributor to anomalous energy transports than are changes in the overturning
circulation strength.  However, the closer one gets to the ITCZ, the less
effective this stability-based mechanism is, which we argue helps explain why
the ITCZ position is tightly linked to local anomalous energy fluxes.
