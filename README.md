# Source code for my academic website
#Amazing create website
This repository comprises the source code I use to generate [my academic website](https://www.its.caltech.edu/~shill/).  I write the website as a set of [Emacs org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) files, and then use org's [publishing](http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html) capabilities to generate the HTML.

I chose to host this on Github because I really like org-mode and thought that my website provides a nice, non-trivial example of using org's export capabilites.  (I also have a [repo for my C.V.](https://github.com/spencerahill/my-cv), which is also written in org, which is much simpler.)

# Contents
* If you're looking for the rendered version of my website, visit it at https://www.its.caltech.edu/~shill/.
* If you want to see the org code used to generate the HTML, see the [org](https://github.com/spencerahill/my-website/tree/master/org) subdirectory in this repo.
* If you want to see the HTML files that generated from the .org file, see the .html files in the [pub](https://github.com/spencerahill/my-website/tree/master/pub) subdirectory of this repo.

# Publishing to HTML from .org yourself
I will eventually populate this with instructions on how to publish the HTML files from the .org files; doing so requires non-trivial configuring within Emacs.
